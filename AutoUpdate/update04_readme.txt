Well it was a looong time between updates, but here it is: Release 4 of Deranged Raid. In this version you get...

X) Multiplayer !!! (VERY beta)

X) Tanks

X) Trees

X) Weather effects

X) Stars at night

X) New models & sounds

X) External Camera

X) Compatibility mode (looks ugly)

X) Many bugfixes


As always, this is by no means a finished game nor a commercial product. If you don't like it, well I'm sorry but then you didn't pay me money either. If you'd like to have something changed, please post it on the DRaid Forum at http://www.playspoon.com/forums

I hope that this game works on your system and that you like it. Please search the forums first before emailing questions, and report new bugs there so I get to know about them.
